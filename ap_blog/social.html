                    <h3>AP Human Geography</h3>
                    <p>From what I remember about the class, you learn a brief history about each region of the world, and you explore how humans have been impacting the environment from the first Agricultural Revolution. This class does require some memorizing as there is a lot of vocabulary and you do need to know examples for those words. I just remember that half the year (an exaggeration of course) was coloring maps before the bell rings, which was exciting (who doesn't love coloring).</p>

                    <h3>AP World History: Modern</h3>
                    <p>"Modern" is at the end of the course title because I'm pretty sure the previous curriculum required you to learn about what happened from the year 3500 BCE. The current curriculum only dates back to 1200 AD. You learn about the networks between different regions and countries, the transoceanic interconnections, revolutions, industrialization, global conflict, the Cold War, and globalization. Instead of just talking about the events and memorizing useless facts, this class makes you think about the consequences of those events and how they impact our lives today, which is something I find interesting.</p>

                    <h3>AP United States History</h3>
                    <p>APUSH is kind of like AP World History, except instead of the world, the class only focuses on the history and development of the United States. It starts from pre-colonialization, so you will learn a bit about the European countries in the 1400s, but other than that, the curriculum focuses solely on the US and its role in global and domestic events. You'll compare economies, beliefs, cultures, and people between periods and regions in the US. You'll also write a couple of essays throughout the class as the AP exam requires you to write a DBQ and an LEQ. There is a LOT of reading, though.

                    <h3>AP Macroeconomics</h3>
                    <p>This class focuses on the principles that apply to the economic system as a whole, emphasizing national income and price-level discrimination. You'll also develop familiarity with economic performance measures, the financial sector, stabilization policies, economic growth, and international economics. It's important to note that this class will only last one semester (either a fall semester or a spring semester).</p>

                    <h3>AP United States Government and Politics</h3>
                    <p>This class is a nonpartisan intro to key political concepts, ideas, institutions, policies, and interactions that constitutionalize the political culture of the US. You'll also look at different Supreme Court decisions and foundational documents to gain an understanding of the relationships and interactions among political institutions. This class also only lasts one semester. The class itself is chill, but you will need to put in a little effort to watch/read outside of class so that you can do well in the class.</p>
