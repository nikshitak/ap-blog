                    <h3>AP English Language and Composition</h3>
                    <p>This class explores the development and revision of evidence-based analytic and argumentative writing as well as the rhetorical analysis of nonfiction texts. You'll learn how to identify the rhetorical situation, describe how it affects the reader, and write about how the organization of the text affects the development of the argument. You'll be writing lots of essays throughout the year to prep you for the AP Exam, so be mentally prepared for that.</p>

                    <h3>AP English Literature and Composition</h3>
                    <p>Like AP English Language, you'll analyze differnt texts, except in this course you'll focus on texts from different periods. You'll engage in close reading and critical analysis of imaginative literature to deepen understanding of how authors use language to provide meaning. Throughout the course, you'll explain the function of word choice, imagery, and symbolism concerning the text, as well as explore character, setting, figurative language, structure, narration, and literary argumentation.</p>

                    <h3>AP Spanish Language and Culture</h3>
                    <p>In this course, you'll revisit the grammar of Spanish and you'll be able to converse better in the language. You'll apply interpretive and presentational skills such as vocabulary usage, language control, and communication strategies in your presentations and essays. You'll learn about cultures and practices of different spanish speaking countries, which will help you apply the big ideas on the AP Exam. You'll also be asked to answer questions based off of text and graphs/data tables. I found this class to be not too terrible; the questions weren't that hard, and the AP exam didn't seem too out of the ordinary.</p>

                    <h3>AP Spanish Literature and Culture</h3>
                    <p>Using the reading skills from Spanish Lang, you'll look at novels, essays, short-stories, poetry, and plays from various Spanish-speaking countries. Through careful examination of the required readings and other texts, students work to hone their critical reading and analytical writing skills. By looking at the text in the context of its period and setting, studnets gain insight on the culture and history of the country. I'd recommend taking AP Spanish Language before taking this class, as that class builds the foundation of reading comprehension for various spanish texts and graphs, which will be useful for this course. You're also going to be writing lots of essays for this course, so be prepared for that.</p>
