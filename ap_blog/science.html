                    <h3>AP Physics 1</h3>
                    <p class="description">This class is an algebra-based physics course, where you'll be taught about
                        kinematics, circular motion, energy, momentum, simple harmonic motion, and rotational motion.
                        There are going to be lots of labs so that you can get a better understanding of the content,
                        but they did require quite a bit of effort to understand. Some of the Gizmos and PHET labs that
                        we did were fun, though. I found this class to be one of the more difficult classes.</p>

                    <h3>AP Physics 2</h3>
                    <p>This class builds on Physics 1, exploring the fundamentals of physics as well as fluids, thermodynamics, electric fields and circuits, magnetism, geometric and physical optics, as well as quantum, atomic, and nuclear physics. Just like Physics 1, this class will have lots of labs so that you can get a thorough understanding of the topics. I did find this class slightly easier than Physics 1 because I learned the fundamentals, but the class required much more time to do the homework as well as comprehend information for tests and such.</p>

                    <h3>AP Biology</h3>
                    <p>This is a college-level introductory biology course, where you'll explore evolution, energetics, information storage, and interactions between biological systems. Like all the AP science courses, there will be an abundant of labs, where you'll need to describe how to collect data as well as how conclusions drawn from the labs would apply to larger biological concepts. You might need to study outside of class for it, but other than that, it's a fine class.</p>

                    <h3>AP Chemistry</h3>
                    <p>A college-level course that expands on an honors chemistry course. Some prerequisites for this are the completion of Algebra 2 and some form of a high school Chemistry class. You'll need some sort of notebook to keep track of all the information in the class. In this class, you'll learn about atomic properties and structures, molecular and ionic compound structure and properties, chemical reactions, kinetics, applications of thermodynamics, equilibrium, acids and bases, as well as intermolecular forces and properties.</p>

                    <h3>AP Environmental Science</h3>
                    <p>In this class, you'll learn the scientific principles and methodologies required to understand the interrelationships within the natural world. You'll learn about ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as land and water use, pollution, and global change. In short, you'll learn about the changes and consequences of human activity on the environment. My friend described this class as "something you'd need as a future farmer" and she isn't wrong. This class is useful for future environmental engineers or anyone else working with ecosystems and trying to better our relationship with the environment.</p>
